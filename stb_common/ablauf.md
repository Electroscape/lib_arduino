first clean up common into sperate Cpp files

  - slave requests initialisation
  - master hands out settings
  
  ! feasibility check, i do need to define certain things at compiletime, unless i create the mixumum amount of readers each time.

  hence first create a rcv for the slave, having the option to link fncs would be kinda required???


ASCII ACK und NACK characters??
